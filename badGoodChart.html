This chart is from CBS News, but has since been removed. It can now be viewd <a href="https://www.painting-with-numbers.com/blog/getting-high-on-bad-data-visualization/">here</a>
<h1>The bad chart:</h1>

<p>
    This chart is bad for a number of reasons. First, the numbers in the pie chart do not add up to 100%. Second, the source listed does not seem to be an actual source, but instead a listing of the margin of error. Additionally, the size of the pie slices is not proportional to the value, with the 51% slice seeming to take up closer to a third of the circle, rather than half. Further, the title is a little generic, and could be interperted in a few ways, including ones that are not correct.

<h1>An improved chart</h1>

<p>
This chart improves on the bad chart above in a few ways. Firstly, it uses a better visualization type for the data, using a bar chart with bars for each time period, rather than trying to combine time periods into a pie chart, where the slices add up to more than 100%. Further, it uses a title that is less open to interpertaion, and that clearly indicates what is being shown. Additionally, it clearly indicates the data source in the data source section, rather than putting information about margin of error as the source. it clearly indicates the trend, following standard axis practices for bar charts of starting at 0 on the y axis, and shows how there is an increase in people who responded that they had tried it.
