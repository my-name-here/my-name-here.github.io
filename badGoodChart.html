<h1>The bad chart:</h1>

<p>
    This chart is bad for a number of reasons. First, the numbers in the pie chart do not add up to 100%. Second, the source listed does not seem to be an actual source, but instead a listing of the margin of error. Additionally, the size of the pie slices is not proportional to the value, with the 51% slice seeming to take up closer to a third of the circle, rather than half. Further, the title is a little generic, and could be interperted in a few ways, including ones that are not correct.
